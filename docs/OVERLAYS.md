# Weather + Headline Overlays

An on-device alternative to the companion
[esp32-photoframe-server](https://github.com/aitjcize/esp32-photoframe-server)'s weather overlay
and smart collage — no separate server required. Two independently toggleable overlays, drawn as a
short text bar across the **top** of the image whenever a wake rotates to a new photo:

- **Weather**: a 3-day forecast (today + next 2 days) — weekday, condition, and min/max
  temperature per day, e.g. `Wed sunny 16/24 | Thu partly cloudy 17/25 | Fri rain -5/3` — from
  [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) — free, no API key, no signup.
- **Headlines**: up to 3 news headline titles, from any RSS or Atom feed you configure — no API
  key, no rate limit, works with essentially any news outlet.

Both share two appearance settings (Web UI only):

- **Colors**: black bar/white text (default) or inverted (white bar/black text). A separate
  checkbox extends this to Telegram photo captions too (off by default — captions keep their
  fixed look unless explicitly opted in).
- **Language**: English (default) or German — selects both the weekday abbreviations
  (`Mon..Sun` / `Mo..So`) and the weather condition wording.

### Line-width limits

This firmware targets several boards with very different panel widths (see `boards/boards.json`) -
from 800px (Waveshare PhotoPainter, Seeed XIAO EE04, reTerminal E1002) up to 1872px (Seeed XIAO
EE03, reTerminal E1003). The overlay text uses a fixed-width 17px-per-character bitmap font
regardless of panel size, so the character budget scales with it: roughly `(panel_width_px - 8) /
17` characters per line - about **46** on the narrowest (800px) boards, ~70 on the 1200px boards,
and ~109 on the widest (1872px) ones.

A single day's weather segment (`Wed sunny 16/24`) fits comfortably on every supported board, even
in the worst case (a long condition word plus 3-digit negative temperatures on both ends, e.g.
`Wed hvy.storm+hail -10/-11` ≈ 27 characters). **Three days combined onto one line** is the case
that varies by board: on the widest boards (~109 chars) every combination fits; on the narrowest
800px boards (~46 chars) it generally does not, even after abbreviating condition words as far as
reasonably legible (`Gewitter` → `Gew.`, `hvy. storm + hail` → `hvy.storm+hail`, etc.) - worst case
there is still well over twice the line budget. There is no way to guarantee all three days on one
line with text alone on the narrower boards; the options are: accept that some combinations
truncate on the single-line layout, or use the 3-line layout below, which always fits regardless of
panel width. (Small fixed-size icons instead of condition words would also help on narrow boards,
but weren't implemented - the 3-line layout already solves the fitting problem completely there, at
much lower cost than authoring a new bitmap icon set.)

- **Weather as 3 lines**: when the headlines overlay is off, an option renders the weather as one
  line per day instead of one combined line — reliably fits every combination. Not offered while
  headlines are also on (not enough vertical room for both).
- **Headline word-wrap**: when exactly 1 headline is selected, an option wraps it across 2 or 3
  display lines instead of hard-truncating it to one line with `…`.

Smart collage (combining two mismatched-orientation photos instead of showing one letterboxed) is
a separate, already-existing feature — see [Multi-image orientation
pairing](TELEGRAM.md#multi-image-orientation-pairing) and [Auto-rotate orientation
pairing](TELEGRAM.md#auto-rotate-orientation-pairing) in the Telegram docs.

## How it works

1. Both overlays are off by default. Enable either independently via the Web UI (Settings →
   Power → Weather + Headline Overlays) or a Telegram command (`/weather on|off`,
   `/headlines on|off`).
2. On every rotation-triggered display (Storage/SD rotation or a Telegram-received image) **and**
   on a Web UI "Display Image" gallery selection, if either overlay is enabled, the frame fetches
   fresh weather/headline data and draws it as one bar across the top of the image **before** the
   single panel refresh — never a second refresh, and the original saved album file on disk is
   never modified (the overlay is drawn onto a throwaway scratch copy, re-created every time).
3. If a fetch fails (no network, feed unreachable, etc.), that overlay is silently skipped for the
   cycle — never blocks the normal image display.
4. **Refresh cadence is tied to your existing rotation schedule** — there's no separate wake timer
   for overlays (the e-paper panel has no partial-refresh capability, so waking more often than
   your chosen rotation interval just to refresh text would cost extra full panel refreshes and
   battery for no real benefit). A sparse rotation schedule (e.g. once a day, or less) means
   correspondingly stale weather/headlines — refreshing only as often as the frame already wakes is
   the deliberate trade-off here.
5. **Not available in URL rotation mode**: that mode streams pixels row-by-row straight to the
   panel and never produces a processed image file to draw an overlay onto (the same reason the
   error-overlay feature can't use it either). Storage and Telegram rotation modes are unaffected.
6. **Applies to processed PNG images always; EPDGZ optionally (opt-in); BMP never.** This affects
   **both** Storage mode and Telegram mode, not just Storage - a common trap, since EPDGZ is the
   *recommended default* for both: Storage-mode albums are, per the SD-card convention this
   project otherwise assumes (see [docs/FACE_CROP.md](FACE_CROP.md)), typically already-rendered
   EPDGZ files rather than PNG; and Telegram-received photos are *also* EPDGZ by default (Telegram
   tab → "On-device image format", defaults to EPDGZ). Either way, without the toggle below, those
   images are skipped entirely (both the visual bar **and** the weather/headline fetch behind it),
   silently and without an error - so it's easy to enable weather/headlines, see nothing happen,
   and not realize this unrelated-looking toggle is why. Enable **Settings → Weather + Headline
   Overlays → "Also overlay pre-rendered EPDGZ images"** (off by default) to cover them too: the
   file is decoded back to RGB, the overlay is drawn, and it's re-encoded as EPDGZ (falling back to
   PNG if EPDGZ's ~260 KB of deflate state can't be allocated at that moment) - an extra
   decode/redraw/re-encode round-trip on every display of that image, which is why this isn't on
   by default. `.bmp` files remain entirely unsupported either way - the firmware has no BMP
   *decoder* (only a one-way PNG→BMP writer, used for boards whose native display format is BMP),
   so there's no RGB buffer for our own code to draw onto. If weather/headlines seem to never be
   fetched at all even though everything looks configured correctly (in **either** rotation mode),
   check whether the images actually being shown are BMP, or EPDGZ with this toggle off (the device
   log shows "Skipping overlay for `<path>`: not a processed PNG or EPDGZ", or "...: EPDGZ overlay
   support is disabled", when either applies).

## Why there's no partial-refresh ("delta update") mode

Investigated and **not implemented**: only a full-panel refresh is possible on every color board this
project targets, `waveshare_photopainter_73` included, so a "redraw just the overlay bar" mode isn't
buildable there at all.

`components/epaper_driver_ed2208_gca/src/driver_ed2208_gca.c` (the Waveshare PhotoPainter's driver,
and `epaper_driver_ed2208_nca` for the reTerminal E1002/E1004 - the same command family) exposes
exactly one display primitive, `epaper_display(uint8_t *image)`, which always transmits the entire
packed framebuffer (`DATA_START_TRANSMISSION`) followed by one `DISPLAY_REFRESH` covering the whole
panel. There is no coordinate/rectangle parameter anywhere in this command set, and none of the
2208-family commands sent during `send_init_sequence()`/`display_update_cycle()` correspond to a
partial-window update. This isn't a driver oversight - it reflects a real limitation of 6-color
("Spectra 6"/ACeP-style) e-paper technology itself: producing each of the 6 ink colors correctly
requires multiple voltage-driven passes across the **entire** panel simultaneously, so there is no
commercially available 6-color e-paper panel today with a genuine partial-refresh mode, independent
of which controller or driver code is used.

The grayscale boards (Seeed XIAO EE03, reTerminal E1003) use a different controller (IT8951,
`components/epaper_driver_it8951`) that *does* define a windowed-update primitive
(`it8951_display_area(x, y, w, h, mode)`, including a fast binary `IT8951_MODE_A2` mode) at the
protocol level - IT8951 hardware genuinely supports partial updates for grayscale content. This
driver only ever calls it with the full panel rectangle today, though, and actually wiring up a
"redraw just the overlay bar's rows" mode (deciding the exact row range, handling A2 mode's
ghosting/quality trade-off, threading it through `board_hal`'s per-board abstraction so PNG/EPDGZ
boards keep their current full-refresh behavior) is a real, separate feature - not implemented here,
since the required board (`waveshare_photopainter_73`) can't support it at all and a
grayscale-boards-only partial implementation would leave every color board unaffected and add a
second code path to maintain for a fraction of the supported hardware.


## Weather setup

Configure a location one of two ways:

- **Location name** (e.g. "Berlin"): geocoded once via Open-Meteo's free geocoding API on first
  use (in the overlay language, so results match German or English place names), then cached —
  subsequent wakes reuse the cached coordinates and only re-geocode if you change the name.
  Geocoding always goes through Open-Meteo, regardless of which forecast provider (below) is
  selected.
- **Latitude/Longitude**: set both directly to skip geocoding entirely.

Day boundaries (which calendar day each forecast entry belongs to) use Open-Meteo's
`timezone=auto`, which resolves the correct local timezone from the coordinates server-side —
independent of the device's own configured timezone (a POSIX TZ string like `UTC0`, not directly
usable as an Open-Meteo timezone parameter).

### Weather data source

Three free, keyless providers are available (Web UI: Settings → Auto Rotate → Weather + Headline
Overlays → "Weather data source"):

- **Open-Meteo** (default) — the source described above.
- **[wttr.in](https://wttr.in/)** — no setup, pulls from a mix of free weather sources in the
  background.
- **[yr.no](https://api.met.no/)** (MET Norway) — globally accurate, widely used as a fallback by
  other open-source projects; requests must include an identifying User-Agent, which the firmware
  sends automatically.

wttr.in and yr.no exist as manual alternatives to switch to if Open-Meteo isn't reachable or
reliable for your network/region — there's no automatic runtime fallback between the three, so
only one is ever queried per cycle. Each provider's own condition codes are approximated into the
same short condition vocabulary described above, so the displayed text looks the same regardless of
source; day-boundary handling differs slightly per provider (yr.no in particular buckets by UTC
calendar date rather than local time, since it has no per-location timezone parameter — see
`weather.c`'s `fetch_yrno()` for specifics).

## Headlines setup

Paste any RSS or Atom feed URL (e.g. `https://www.tagesschau.de/xml/rss2/`,
`http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml`, or your outlet of choice). Choose how many headlines to
show (1-3, default 3). Titles are extracted with a small purpose-built parser (not a full
XML/RSS library) - CDATA and the common HTML entities are handled, and everything is
transliterated to plain ASCII to match the display font.

## Low battery badge

A third, architecturally different overlay sharing the same render hook as the two above, but
**off by default** and visually much smaller by design: instead of a full-width bar, it's a small
fixed-size corner badge (`"BATT NN%"`, sized to just that short text - roughly 17% of an 800px-wide
panel's width, versus 100% for the weather/headline bar) drawn in the top-left corner. Intended to
be noticeable without needing the Web UI or Telegram, so a discharging battery doesn't go
unnoticed.

Enable it in the Web UI (Settings → Power → Overlays → "Low battery badge") and set a threshold
percentage (default 16%). The badge appears on every display update once the battery drops below
that threshold, and clears once it recovers 4 percentage points above it (a fixed hysteresis
margin, not independently configurable, so a battery hovering right at the edge doesn't flicker the
badge on and off every wake) - this state is remembered across deep sleep, not just held in memory.

Colors follow the panel's own capability: red background on color-capable (Spectra6) boards, black
on grayscale-only (GC16) boards where red isn't a real color option; white text either way. When
weather/headlines are also active on the same image, the badge draws on top, inset into the left
edge of that bar rather than needing its own separate space - when they're both off, the badge
appears alone. Unlike the two overlays above, it isn't blocked by "Also overlay pre-rendered EPDGZ
images" being off, since it's a safety notification rather than a decorative overlay.

## Capture-date caption for Storage/Auto-Rotate photos

"Show capture date as caption when a photo has none" (Settings → Telegram, `/exif_date`) - despite
living in the Telegram settings section - now also applies to Storage/Auto-Rotate album images
(bottom-anchored caption bar, drawn via the same `overlay_manager_apply()` hook as the overlays
above, so it never collides with them). This includes Telegram-mode's own fallback-to-storage
picture, since that reuses the identical rotation code as Storage mode's primary rotation.

**Why this needed a separate mechanism from the Telegram case**: once a photo is dithered/
palette-quantized into a display-ready PNG/EPDGZ/BMP, its EXIF is gone - and for the Storage/SD-card
ingestion path, the original camera JPEG is (per this project's own documented convention) generally
never kept on the device at all, only the rendered output. So there's no way for the *firmware* to
recover a capture date after the fact for this path - it has to be captured once, at *processing*
time, by whichever tool actually had access to the original: **process-cli**.

`process-cli` now writes a small `<name>.capture.json` sidecar (schema-versioned like its sibling
`<name>.facecrop.json`, but deliberately a separate file - a capture date shouldn't require face
detection to be enabled) whenever the source photo has an EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` tag, unconditionally
(no extra flag needed - a no-op when there's no EXIF to find). The firmware reads this sidecar back
(`main/exif_reader.c`'s `capture_date_sidecar_read()`) only while the Web UI setting above is on,
associating it with the shared source photo regardless of which rendered variant (`<name>.<ext>`,
`<name>.fit.<ext>`, or `crop/<name>.cover.<ext>`) is actually on screen.

**Known limitations, not solved by this feature**:
- Web UI album uploads (`ImageUpload.vue`) are converted entirely client-side in the browser and
  don't currently extract/persist EXIF at all - a Web-UI-uploaded photo never gets a capture-date
  sidecar, even with an EXIF-carrying original. Achieving parity would need a separate browser-side
  implementation.
- A Telegram-originated composed/paired image (which may already carry its own baked-in caption)
  could theoretically pick up a *second*, EXIF-derived caption if it later gets rotated through
  Storage mode - a rare edge case, not specifically detected/prevented.
