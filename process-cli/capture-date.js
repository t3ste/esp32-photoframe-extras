/**
 * Versioned per-image capture-date sidecar (`<basename>.capture.json`).
 *
 * Deliberately a separate file from `face-crop/metadata.js`'s `.facecrop.json`
 * (not folded into it) - that sidecar is only written when `--detect-faces` is
 * used, and a capture date shouldn't require face detection to be enabled.
 * Same one-file-per-source-image rationale as its sibling: robust against
 * files being moved/copied independently, trivial for the firmware to
 * associate with its source image, no database to keep in sync.
 *
 * The original camera JPEG's EXIF is the only place a capture date can come
 * from - once a photo is dithered/palette-quantized into a display-ready
 * PNG/EPDGZ/BMP, that information is gone for good, and (per this project's
 * own documented SD-card convention) the original is generally never kept on
 * the device at all. So this has to be captured here, at processing time, not
 * reconstructed later on-device.
