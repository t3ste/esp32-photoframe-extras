 * Computes a recommended crop rectangle (source-image pixel space) for

 * Strategy ("largest-face-priority"):
 *  1. Start from the largest face's raw box (no margin yet).
 *  2. Walk the remaining faces, largest to smallest, growing the working
 *     bounding box to include each one's raw box - but only accept a face if
 *     the resulting crop (grown to target's aspect ratio - using as much of
 *     the source image as fits, not just the minimum needed - then clamped
 *     to image bounds) still fully contains everything accepted so far. A
 *     face that doesn't fit without pushing an already-included, larger face
 *     out of frame is skipped (left to be cropped), never the other way
 *     around.
 *  3. Only once that set of faces is settled, expand the union by the
 *     safety margin, then grow/clamp the same way for the final crop.
 *     Margin is deliberately applied once, at the end, rather than per-face
 *     before the fit checks in step 2 - doing it per-face let the margin
 *     buffer's own size, not the faces themselves, decide whether a face got
 *     dropped: two faces whose bare bounding boxes fit the target with room
 *     to spare could still fail the check once each got its own margin added
 *     first, because the margins alone pushed the union just over the
 *     image's available height/width. Confirmed on real output: two faces
 *     needing only ~511px of vertical span (well inside an available 583px)
 *     were margin-inflated to ~585px first - just barely over - so the
 *     second face was wrongly dropped, centering the crop on the first face
 *     alone and clipping the second one's top out of frame.
