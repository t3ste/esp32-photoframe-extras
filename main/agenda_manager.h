 * a conditional GET (If-None-Match against the previous cycle's ETag) - an
 * unchanged source skips the download and re-parses a small on-device
 * cache instead, but the render itself is always redone (day-relative
 * coloring/grouping still depends on the current date, not just the source
 * content).
 *
 * Caller (deep_sleep_wake_main()) is responsible for going back to sleep
 * afterward - this function never sleeps itself.
 *
 * `wifi_connected` reports whether THIS wake's connection attempt actually
 * succeeded (main.c already knows this before calling in) - when false, the
 * three network-dependent sources (Calendar A/B, ToDo, weather) are skipped
 * outright instead of each independently retrying and timing out against a
 * connection that's already known to not exist. Calendar C/D/E (pure local
 * reads of already-cached files - see load_extra_ics_source()) and the
 * climate reading are unaffected either way, so a WiFi-down cycle still
 * renders normally using whatever local sources are configured. Confirmed
 * live (2026-09-20): a wake whose WiFi connect attempt failed still spent
 * ~15s retrying doomed DNS/TLS connections for Calendar A/B/weather before
 * falling back to local-only content it could have rendered immediately.
