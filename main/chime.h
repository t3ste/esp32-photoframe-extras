 * the master speaker mode (off / battery+mains / mains-only, gated on
 * board_hal_is_usb_connected() for mains-only), quiet hours, this event's
 * own enable flag, and a per-event/per-boot fire-count cap (see chime.c) -
 * then maps the event to a board_hal_chime_kind_t severity and plays it.
 * Safe to call unconditionally from any hook site; every gate is a no-op
 * skip, never an error.

 * false until the condition actually clears - at which point the counter
 * resets, so a later recurrence of the same problem repeats again from 1.
