/**
 * @file config_track.h
 * @brief Which fields of a config request apply_config_from_json() ignored.
 *
 * The handlers of apply_config_from_json() each look one field up with cJSON_GetObjectItem() and
 * take it only when its JSON type is the one they read (`item && cJSON_IsString(item)`). A field of
 * another type - `"rotation_interval": "soon"` - is skipped without a word, and so is a key no
 * handler knows (a typo, or a setting of another firmware): the request still answers "success".
 *
 * This remembers, for the direct children of one request object, which were looked up and which
 * were taken, so the answer can name the rest. It is a small state machine of one request at a time
 * (a second begin while one is running tracks nothing); the object being applied must not be
 * changed or freed between begin and end.
