/**
 * @brief Fetches up to `max_days` (clamped to [1, WEATHER_FORECAST_DAYS_CAP])
 * of daily min/max temperature + condition for the configured location, from
 * whichever provider config_manager_get_weather_provider() selects -
 * Open-Meteo (default), wttr.in, or yr.no (MET Norway). All three are
 * free/keyless; wttr.in and yr.no exist as user-selectable alternatives if
 * Open-Meteo isn't reachable/reliable for a given network/region - there is
 * no automatic runtime failover between them. Each provider's own condition
 * code/text is approximated into the same WMO-code vocabulary
 * condition_text() understands, so callers/formatting are provider-agnostic.
 * Open-Meteo's response uses "timezone=auto" (resolves the correct local
 * timezone from the coordinates server-side); yr.no has no such parameter
 * and buckets by UTC calendar date instead (see fetch_yrno() in weather.c
 * for the specific trade-offs that implies). wttr.in's free `j1` format returns
 * 3 days only: for more, the missing days are taken from Open-Meteo.
 *
 * Resolution order: if both config_manager_get_weather_lat()/_lon() are set,
 * uses them directly. Otherwise, geocodes config_manager_get_weather_location_name()
 * via Open-Meteo's free geocoding endpoint (used for geocoding regardless of
 * the selected forecast provider) - but only when that name differs
 * from config_manager_get_weather_geocoded_name() (the cached result of the
 * last successful geocode); a match reuses the cached lat/lon, so geocoding
 * only costs a request once per location-name change, not every call.
 *
 * On success, also records the provider used via
 * config_manager_set_weather_last_source() - lets /status (telegram_bot.c)
 * report which service actually produced the currently-displayed data,
 * distinct from config_manager_get_weather_provider() (the configured
 * preference, which may not match if the last attempt against it failed).
 *
 * Best-effort: any network/parse failure returns an error and leaves *out
 * zeroed (valid = false) - callers should treat this as "no weather this
 * cycle", never fatal to the caller's own flow.
