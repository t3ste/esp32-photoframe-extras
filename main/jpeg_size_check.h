/**
 * @file jpeg_size_check.h
 * @brief A check of the size that esp_jpeg reports for a JPEG (build option `fixes`).
 *
 * esp_jpeg_get_image_info() and esp_jpeg_decode() work out the size of the decoded picture as
 * (height / scale) * (width / scale) * bytes_per_pixel in 32 bit, from the sides in the header of
 * the file. A header that says 40000 x 35792 pixels makes that 4 295 040 000 bytes, which wraps to
 * 72 704; the decoder's own test that the buffer is large enough uses the same wrapped number, and
 * it then writes the picture with the real sides, far past the buffer. The sides come from a file
 * that came from outside (an upload, a download), so the size is worked out again here, in 64 bit,
 * before a buffer is allocated.

 *        width and height, whatever the scale).
 * @param shift The scale as a number of halvings (JPEG_IMAGE_SCALE_0 = 0 ... 1_8 = 3).
 * @param output_len The size esp_jpeg reported for 3 bytes a pixel (RGB888).
