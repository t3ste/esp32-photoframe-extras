//    TELEGRAM_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY as "img_<unix-timestamp>.<ext>". For
//    Telegram "photo" messages (which carry several re-encoded resolutions,
//    largest last) the largest is tried first; on failure (too large,
//    network error, or an unsupported *progressive* JPEG - Telegram
//    re-encodes compressed photos as progressive JPEG, which this
//    firmware's JPEG decoder cannot decode) the next smaller size is tried,
//    down to the smallest, until one succeeds or all fail.
//  - The newest successfully downloaded image is run through the existing
//    processing pipeline and shown on the display; older images stay on
//    storage for later rotation cycles.
//  - Any message text starting with "/" (other than the reset command) is
//    queued as a pending command.
//  - Persists the highest update_id seen (+1 offset) to NVS so updates are
//    never re-processed.
