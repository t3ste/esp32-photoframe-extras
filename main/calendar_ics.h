/**
 * @brief Fetches `url` (an iCalendar/ICS feed - e.g. a Google Calendar
 * "secret address in iCal format", a plain authless HTTPS GET) and
 * extracts non-recurring VEVENTs overlapping [window_start, window_end).
 *
 * Recurring events (a VEVENT with an RRULE) are not expanded by this pass
 * - see calendar_ics.c's RRULE-lite extension for DAILY/WEEKLY support.
 * An RRULE'd event with none of the supported forms is silently skipped
 * (fail-soft: better to omit one event than show a wrong occurrence).
 *
 * If `cache_path` is non-NULL, this is a conditional GET: `etag_in` (may be
 * NULL/empty) is sent as If-None-Match, and on a 304 reply the body cached
 * at `cache_path` from the last successful 200 is re-parsed instead of
 * re-downloading - the parse itself is still redone every call, since which
 * events fall in [window_start, window_end) shifts day to day even when the
 * feed's content hasn't changed at all. `etag_out`/`etag_out_len` receive
 * the validator to persist for next time (already carries forward `etag_in`
 * if this response didn't repeat an ETag) - the caller owns actually
 * persisting it (see config_manager.h's agenda ETag getters/setters). Pass
 * cache_path/etag_in/etag_out as NULL to skip conditional-GET entirely and
 * always fetch unconditionally.
 *
 * Best-effort: a fetch failure returns an error and leaves *out zeroed
 * (count = 0).
