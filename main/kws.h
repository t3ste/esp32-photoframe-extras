/*
 * Keyword ("Wortmuster") spotting for switching off a ringing alarm by voice.
 *
 * Deliberately small and self-contained (no ML runtime, no ESP-IDF calls) so it
 * can be unit-tested on the host: the user enrols the stop word by speaking it
 * a few times; every enrolment becomes a template of MFCC feature frames, and
 * later utterances are compared with the templates by dynamic time warping
 * (DTW), which absorbs different speaking speeds. Nothing leaves the frame and
 * no audio is stored - only the feature templates.
 *
 * Pipeline: 16 kHz mono PCM -> voice-activity segmentation (loudest speech
 * region) -> 25 ms / 10 ms log-mel MFCC (12 coefficients, liftered, cepstral
 * mean normalised so overall level and microphone colouring drop out) -> DTW
 * distance to each template (Sakoe-Chiba band, length-normalised) -> best
 * distance; below the matcher's threshold counts as the keyword.
