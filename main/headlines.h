 * @brief Fetches `feed_url` (any RSS or Atom feed - no API key, no rate
 * limit) and extracts up to `max_count` (clamped to
 * [1, HEADLINE_MAX_COUNT]) headline titles, in feed order.
 *
 * Uses a lightweight, purpose-built extractor - NOT a full XML/RSS parser:
 * scans for `<item>`/`<entry>` blocks (RSS/Atom respectively), pulls the
 * `<title>` within each, unwraps CDATA, decodes a small fixed set of HTML
 * entities, and runs the result through
 * image_processor_sanitize_ascii() so titles are already ASCII-safe by the
 * time they reach the display overlay code. Each title is truncated to
 * HEADLINE_MAX_LEN - 1 chars.
 *
 * Best-effort: a fetch failure returns an error and leaves *out zeroed
 * (count = 0). A response larger than the internal fetch cap is still
 * parsed from whatever prefix was captured, rather than treated as a
 * failure - a feed with more items than fit is still useful for its first
 * few.
