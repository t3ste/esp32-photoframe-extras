# ESP32 PhotoFrame — a configurable fork

> **Extended edition.** This is the `extras` line of the firmware: the base project
> ([t3stier/esp32-photoframe-rebuild](https://github.com/t3stier/esp32-photoframe-rebuild), branch `main`) plus webcal, CalDAV,
> batch upload, duplicate detection, the information pages (weather, exchange rates, fuel prices, markets, ...) and an artworks
> mode, switched on with `--with extras`. It is a hobby-scale variant, **tested on one board only** - see
> [docs/EXTENDED_EDITION.md](docs/EXTENDED_EDITION.md). Releases and the web flasher:
> [t3ste/esp32-photoframe-extras](https://github.com/t3ste/esp32-photoframe-extras).
> **Building it yourself? Set `--ota-repo t3ste/esp32-photoframe-extras` or switch the automatic update check off** (Settings ->
> Power): a frame built from source asks the *base* project for updates by default, and installing one replaces this build with the
> base firmware, which has none of the extras.

> **About this repository.** A rebuild of
> [aitjcize/esp32-photoframe](https://github.com/aitjcize/esp32-photoframe), run as a fork of
> it: the canonical repository is the GitHub fork
> [t3stier/esp32-photoframe-rebuild](https://github.com/t3stier/esp32-photoframe-rebuild)
> (releases, web flasher, update feed);
> [t3ste/esp32-photoframe-rebuild](https://github.com/t3ste/esp32-photoframe-rebuild) is a
> mirror of it. With no build option the firmware and the web UI are the upstream ones; the
> additional features (Telegram, agenda, overlays, alarm clock, HTTPS, ...) are switched on
> one by one at build time, see [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md) and the
> [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). Upstream's history is part of this repository, its

## Optional Features

Every row below is off by default (the firmware is then upstream's own, 1:1) and switched on one at a time -
`python build.py --with telegram,agenda` and so on, `--with extras` for the whole group of newer options (webcal,
CalDAV, multi-upload, duplicate detection, the information pages and the artworks mode), or `--all-features` for everything the board's hardware
supports. This project's own releases, the web flasher, and the frame's OTA update all ship the **full** build for
each board (every feature that board's hardware supports) - see [Installation](#installation). Full list, hardware
needs, and how combinations are validated: [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md). How to use the newer options:

**Why Our Algorithm is Better:**

- ✅ **Accurate Color Matching**: Uses actual measured e-paper colors
- ✅ **Automatic Calibration**: Built-in palette calibration tool adapts to your specific display
- ✅ **Better Dithering**: Floyd-Steinberg algorithm with measured palette produces more natural color transitions
- ✅ **No Over-Saturation**: Avoids the washed-out appearance of theoretical palette matching

The measured palette accounts for the fact that e-paper displays show darker, more muted colors than pure RGB values. By dithering with these actual colors, the firmware makes better decisions about which palette color to use for each pixel, resulting in images that look significantly better on the physical display. The automatic calibration feature allows you to measure and optimize the palette for your specific device.

## Power Management

**Deep Sleep Enabled (Default)**:
- Battery life: months
- Wake via BOOT/KEY button or auto-rotate timer
- Web interface accessible only when awake
- Power: ~10μA in sleep

**Deep Sleep Disabled (Always-On)**:
- Best for Home Assistant integration
- Web interface always accessible
- Power: ~40-80mA with auto light sleep
- Battery life: days to weeks depending on usage

**Auto-Rotation**: SD card (default) or URL-based (fetch from web)

- In URL mode a failed fetch leaves the current picture on the panel (there is no fallback to a local image); the reason is shown as the last fetch error in **Settings > Auto Rotate**.
- When a frame on deep sleep keeps failing its scheduled fetches (weak WiFi, server down), it backs off — 5 minutes, doubling up to 6 hours — by skipping scheduled wakes rather than spending battery on every one. A successful fetch or any button wake clears the backoff. An always-on frame (deep sleep disabled) simply tries again at the next scheduled slot.

**Time zone**: pick your zone in **Settings > General** (DST is handled); the rotation schedule runs in that zone.

Configure via web interface **Settings** section.

## AI Image Generation 🤖

The web interface supports client-side AI image generation using OpenAI (GPT Image, DALL-E) or Google Gemini.

- **Generate on Demand**: Create custom artwork directly from the web interface using text prompts
- **Multiple Providers**: OpenAI and Google Gemini supported
- **Client-Side Processing**: AI generation runs in your browser, then uploads to the device

Configure your API keys in **Settings > AI Generation**.


## Supported Hardware

| Board | Display | Storage | Board Name |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| [Waveshare PhotoPainter](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-PhotoPainter) | 7.3" 6-color | SD card (SDIO) | `waveshare_photopainter_73` |
| [Seeed Studio XIAO EE02](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-ePaper-DIY-Kit-EE02-for-13-3-Spectratm-6-E-Ink.html) | 13.3" 6-color | Internal flash | `seeedstudio_xiao_ee02` |
| [Seeed Studio XIAO EE03](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/getting_started_with_ee03/) | 10.3" 16-level grayscale | Internal flash | `seeedstudio_xiao_ee03` |
| [Seeed Studio XIAO EE04](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-ePaper-EE04-DIY-Bundle-Kit.html) | 7.3" 6-color | Internal flash | `seeedstudio_xiao_ee04` |
| [Seeed Studio reTerminal E1002](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal-E1002-p-6533.html) | 7.3" 6-color | SD card (SPI) + Internal flash | `seeedstudio_reterminal_e1002` |
| [Seeed Studio reTerminal E1003](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal-E1003-p-6731.html) | 10.3" 16-level grayscale | SD card (SPI) + Internal flash | `seeedstudio_reterminal_e1003` |
| [Seeed Studio reTerminal E1004](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal-E1004-p-6692.html) | 13.3" 6-color | SD card (SPI) + Internal flash | `seeedstudio_reterminal_e1004` |
| [M5Stack M5Paper v1.1](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/m5paper_v1.1) | 4.7" 16-level grayscale | SD card (SPI) | `m5stack_m5paper_v11` |

The reTerminal E1002, E1003, and E1004 also include a SHT40 temperature/humidity sensor, PCF8563 RTC, and battery monitoring. The XIAO EE03 has a SHT40 sensor and battery monitoring as well (but no RTC). The M5Paper has an SHT30 sensor, a BM8563 RTC, and battery monitoring.

> **M5Paper note:** this is the only supported board built on the original **ESP32** rather than an ESP32-S3, so its firmware is a separate binary — flash `m5stack_m5paper_v11` and nothing else to it. The **v1.0** and **v1.1** revisions are electrically identical (v1.1 only swapped the rigid panel for a flexible one), so the same firmware runs on both. The touchscreen is not used by this firmware.

### Button Functions

Buttons behave differently depending on whether the device is awake (web UI accessible) or in deep sleep.

**When in deep sleep:**

| Button | Waveshare PhotoPainter | XIAO EE02 / EE03 / EE04 | reTerminal E1002 | reTerminal E1003 | reTerminal E1004 | M5Paper |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Wake** | BOOT button | Button 3 | Green button | Refresh button | Refresh button | Centre (push) button |
| **Rotate** | KEY button | Button 1 | Left button | Left button | Right button | Left button |
| **Clear** | N/A | Button 2 | Right button | Right button | Left button | N/A (awake only) |

- **Wake**: Wakes the device and starts the web UI / HTTP server (stays awake)
- **Rotate**: Wakes the device, rotates to the next image, then goes back to sleep
- **Clear**: Wakes the device, clears the display to white, then goes back to sleep

**When awake:**

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Rotate** | Rotates to the next image |
| **Clear** | Clears the display to white |

### 💾 Internal Flash Storage
Boards with larger flash chips (XIAO EE02/EE03/EE04, reTerminal E1002/E1004) use internal flash as persistent storage via LittleFS. On the reTerminal, the SD card takes priority when inserted; internal flash serves as a fallback. The Waveshare and M5Paper boards do not have internal flash storage due to their 16MB flash being fully allocated to OTA partitions — the M5Paper stores images on its microSD card.

### Known Issues 🚧

- **PhotoPainter Restarts**: All existing Waveshare PhotoPainter boards on the market use the AXP2101 power management IC, which causes unexplained restarts when connected to both Type-C and a lithium battery simultaneously. **Workaround:** use either USB power only or battery only. Using both at the same time may cause frequent firmware restarts due to unstable power supply. Waveshare has confirmed this issue and future boards will ship with TG28 as a replacement, which will not have this problem. See [waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-PhotoPainter#5](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-PhotoPainter/issues/5#issuecomment-3876269519) for details.
- **M5Paper Deep Sleep & USB Power**: the M5Paper routes no USB VBUS signal to a GPIO and has no I2C charger to ask, so the firmware cannot tell whether it is on USB power and will keep going to sleep on its auto-sleep timer while plugged in. **Workaround:** disable deep sleep in **Settings > General** if you want the device always reachable on USB.
- **M5Paper Clear Button**: the original ESP32's wake logic can only distinguish two buttons out of deep sleep (its EXT1 unit cannot match "any of several pins low", so the wake button uses EXT0 and the rotate button uses EXT1). The right-hand **Clear** button therefore only works while the device is awake; press the centre button first to wake it.
- **Seeed Studio Deep Sleep & USB Power**: The XIAO EE02, EE03, and EE04 can only detect USB connections from a **PC** (via USB-Serial-JTAG SOF packets); chargers and power banks will **not** keep them awake (these boards do not route USB VBUS to an ESP32 GPIO). The same applies to **reTerminal E1002 hardware revisions earlier than V1.2**, which use the non-I2C **ETA6003** charger. The reTerminal **E1002 V1.2+** (which switched to the **SY6974B** charger) **and the E1004** read the SY6974B's power-good status over I2C, so they detect *any* USB/charger/power-bank input and stay awake on external power automatically — no workaround needed. The Waveshare PhotoPainter likewise detects USB power via its AXP2101 PMIC. **Workaround (XIAO EE02/EE03/EE04, and E1002 boards older than V1.2):** if you want the device always accessible while powered by a charger or power bank, disable deep sleep in **Settings > General**.

## Installation

### Web Flasher (Easiest) ⚡

**[🌐 Flash from Browser](https://t3stier.github.io/esp32-photoframe-rebuild/#flash)** - Chrome/Edge/Opera required. Flashes part by part, so it keeps your WiFi credentials and settings unless you tick "Erase device".

### Manual Flash

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/t3stier/esp32-photoframe-rebuild/releases) - every release is the **full** build (every optional feature your board's hardware supports, see [Optional Features](#optional-features) above); whoever wants the plain upstream firmware instead gets it from [upstream's own releases](https://github.com/aitjcize/esp32-photoframe/releases).

```bash
# ESP32-S3 boards (everything except the M5Paper)
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 photoframe-firmware-<board>-merged.bin

# M5Stack M5Paper (ESP32)
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 photoframe-firmware-m5stack_m5paper_v11-merged.bin
```

This one-line merged-image flash **erases WiFi credentials and all settings** (it is one contiguous image from offset 0). To keep them, use the web flasher above, or flash the individual parts by hand - see [docs/MAINTAINING.md](docs/MAINTAINING.md#10-web-flasher-and-the-pages-site).

**Device not detected?** Hold BOOT button + press PWR to enter download mode.

**Build from source:**

We provide a `build.py` helper script to simplify building for different boards. With no `--with`/`--all-features` option it builds the plain upstream firmware; see [Optional Features](#optional-features) above for adding any of the build flags.

```bash
# Build for Waveshare PhotoPainter (default)
./build.py --board waveshare_photopainter_73

# Build for Seeed Studio XIAO EE02
./build.py --board seeedstudio_xiao_ee02

# Build for Seeed Studio XIAO EE03 (10.3" 16-level grayscale e-paper)
./build.py --board seeedstudio_xiao_ee03

# Build for Seeed Studio XIAO EE04
./build.py --board seeedstudio_xiao_ee04

# Build for Seeed Studio reTerminal E1002
./build.py --board seeedstudio_reterminal_e1002

# Build for Seeed Studio reTerminal E1003 (10.3" 16-level grayscale e-paper)
./build.py --board seeedstudio_reterminal_e1003

# Build for Seeed Studio reTerminal E1004 (13.3" 6-color e-paper)
./build.py --board seeedstudio_reterminal_e1004

# Build for M5Stack M5Paper v1.0/v1.1 (4.7" 16-level grayscale e-paper, ESP32)
./build.py --board m5stack_m5paper_v11

# Flash the firmware
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

For more details, see [DEV.md](docs/DEV.md)

### WiFi Provisioning

The device supports two methods for WiFi provisioning:

#### Option 1: SD Card Provisioning (boards with SD card only)

1. Create a file named `wifi.txt` on your SD card with:
   ```
   YourWiFiSSID
   YourWiFiPassword
   MyPhotoFrame
   ```
   - Line 1: WiFi SSID (network name)
   - Line 2: WiFi password
   - Line 3: Device name (optional, defaults to "PhotoFrame")
   - Use plain text, no quotes or extra formatting
   - The file can be placed at the root or in a `config/` folder

2. Insert SD card and power on the device
3. Device automatically reads credentials, saves to memory, and connects
4. The `wifi.txt` file is automatically deleted after reading (to prevent issues with invalid credentials)

**Note**: If credentials are invalid, the device will clear them and fall back to captive portal mode.

#### Option 2: Captive Portal

1. Device creates a unique AP on first boot (e.g. `PhotoFrame - A1B2C3`, where `A1B2C3` is derived from the device's MAC address)
2. Connect to the AP and open `http://192.168.4.1` (or use captive portal)
3. Enter WiFi credentials (2.4GHz only)
4. Device tests connection and saves if successful

#### Option 3: Companion App

1. Install the ESP Frame companion app:
   - **iOS**: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/esp-frame/id6762510995?l=en-GB)
   - **Android**: install from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aitjcize.espframe) (free); for early access to new features, join the [beta testers Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/esp32-photoframe-app-testers)
2. Tap the "+" button on the home screen
3. The app scans for PhotoFrame setup hotspots, connects automatically, and guides you through WiFi configuration

**Re-provision:** Delete credentials with `idf.py erase-flash` or place new `wifi.txt` on SD card after clearing stored credentials

## Usage

**Web Interface:** `http://photoframe.local` or device IP address
- Gallery view with drag-and-drop uploads
- Settings, battery status, display control

**Device password (optional):** off by default, since most frames sit on a trusted home network. Turn it on under **Settings > General > Advanced network settings** to require a password for the web interface and the whole HTTP API (the browser prompts for it; any username works). The photoframe server, the Home Assistant integration and the companion app must be given the same password or they stop syncing with the frame. It is HTTP Basic over plain HTTP, so anyone on the same network can read and replay it — it keeps casual visitors out of a shared network, nothing more. A forgotten password cannot be reset over the network (factory reset sits behind it too): connect the frame over USB and erase its settings partition, `esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_region 0x9000 0x6000` (`--chip esp32` on the M5Paper), which also resets WiFi and every other setting but keeps the stored photos; `erase-flash` followed by a reflash wipes the whole internal flash, photos included on boards that store them there (an SD card is untouched either way). Details in [API.md → Authentication](docs/API.md#authentication).

## Troubleshooting

- **WiFi issues**: Ensure 2.4GHz network, check serial monitor for IP
- **SD card not detected**: Format as FAT32, try different card
- **Upload fails**: Check file is valid JPEG, monitor serial output
- **Device not detected for flash**: Hold BOOT + press PWR for download mode
- **Frame restarted on its own**: if the firmware crashed, the next boot keeps a one-line record under **Settings > Maintenance > Last Crash**; **Copy Report** copies it for a bug report, and [DEV.md](docs/DEV.md#decoding-a-crash-report) explains how to turn its addresses into source lines. The dump is written to a flash partition that an over-the-air update cannot add (OTA replaces only the application), so a frame updated over the air to the release that introduced the crash record starts recording crashes after its next USB flash — which keeps the stored photos.

## Offline Image Processing

Node.js CLI tool for batch processing and image serving:

### Batch Processing
```bash
cd process-cli && npm install
# Process to disk
node cli.js input.jpg --device-parameters -o /path/to/sdcard/images/

# Or upload directly to device
node cli.js ~/Photos/Albums --upload --device-parameters --host photoframe.local
```

### Image Server Mode
Serve pre-processed images directly to your ESP32 over HTTP:

```bash
node cli.js --serve ~/Photos --serve-port 9000 --device-parameters --host photoframe.local
```

The ESP32 can fetch images from your computer instead of storing them on SD card. Supports EPDGZ, BMP, PNG, and JPG formats with automatic thumbnail generation.

See [process-cli/README.md](process-cli/README.md) for details.

**Building your own image server?** The firmware's URL rotation fetch protocol — request method, custom `X-*` headers, `Authorization` / custom-header handling, and the `ETag` / `304 Not Modified` caching flow — is documented in [docs/API.md → URL Rotation Fetch](docs/API.md#url-rotation-fetch).
